  The contracts library violation handling mechanism _shall_ provide for specifying *build mode* behavior

  The build mode determines the behavior of the handler with respect to whether it performs a contract check or not. With build mode set to `DEFAULT` all contracts enforced at the `DEFUALT` level are checked. With build mode set to `AUDIT` all contracts enforced at either the `DEFAULT` or `AUDIT` levels are checked. With build mode set to `OFF` all contract checks are compiled out.
