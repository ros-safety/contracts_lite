  Contracts Lite

  Provide standard practice and tooling to support the explicit definition and enforcement of function contracts. The requirements derived for this library are a subset of those specified for the C++20 contracts proposal here: [http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2018/p0542r5.html](http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2018/p0542r5.html)
